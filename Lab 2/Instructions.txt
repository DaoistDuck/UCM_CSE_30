Instructions
Download the files bigArrays.cpp, and FillUp.h and study the code.

The program reads in an integer from the user and creates an array of that many elements. 
It then call the fillUp function found in FillUp.h, which populates each cell of the array with an integer value corresponding to the index. 
The code then calls the printPos function which prints out the value of the last element of the array.

The code works correctly for small array sizes. Your task is to make it work for array sizes of more than 10 million elements.
 You should not modify the FillUp.h file, because you will not be uploading that file.

Modify the bigArrays.cpp file to meet the requirements above, and upload it for evaluation. 
It must use the fillUp function to get populated, and the printPos function to produce the output.
